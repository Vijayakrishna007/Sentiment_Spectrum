### Project Overview
Sentiment Spectrum is a simple and interactive sentiment analysis web application that allows users to analyze how they feel through text input. The tool detects and counts various types of words such as positive, negative, depressive, and stressful ones—and even flags more severe content like suicidal or violent expressions.

## How It Works
Sign Up / Log In <br>
Users must first sign up and log in to access the sentiment analysis feature. <br>
<br>
Home Page <br>
After logging in, users are redirected to the main page where they can enter a sentence—such as "I’m feeling great today!".
<br>

Analyze Text <br>
On clicking the Analyze button, the system scans the input and returns a breakdown of the word categories:
<br>

Neutral words: 0 <br>
Depression words: 0 <br>
Stress words: 0 <br>
Suicidal words: 0 <br>
Murder words: 0<br>
